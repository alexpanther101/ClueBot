📦 Phase 1: Core Clue Engine
Goal: Build a simplified but complete Clue game engine suitable for AI self-play.

✅ Deliverables
Card setup logic (suspects, weapons, rooms)

Solution envelope creation (1 of each type)

Player hand distribution

Turn-based loop with suggestion, response, accusation

Rules enforcement

🔧 Tools
Python (base)

NumPy (for simulation efficiency)

🧩 Phase 2: Tabular CFR Engine
Goal: Implement baseline CFR with regret matching and information sets.

✅ Deliverables
Information set class

Tabular CFR loop with regret tracking

Regret-matching strategy computation

Self-play loop

Average strategy tracking

🧠 Optional Features
Abstract action space (only reasonable suggestions)

Simplified board state encoding

🤖 Phase 3: Add Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Goal: Enable learning through value estimation and exploration.

✅ Deliverables
Define state/action/reward structure

Implement RL value function (Q-table or DQN)

Define reward shaping logic:

+1 for correct accusation

-1 for false accusation

+0.1 for successful deduction

+0.2 for misleading an opponent

Integrate into CFR loop as:

Value critic for action evaluation

Opponent response prediction

Accusation policy refinement

🧠 Phase 4: Probabilistic Deduction Engine
Goal: Use probability to update beliefs and reason under uncertainty.

✅ Deliverables
Belief matrix (Card × Player → Probability)

Bayesian update logic after each suggestion/response

Incorporate beliefs into CFR action selection and RL reward signals

⚔️ Phase 5: Game-Theoretic Strategy Enhancements
Goal: Enable mixed strategies, deception, and adversarial play.

✅ Deliverables
Track and use mixed strategies (via CFR)

Bluff-aware logic (detect when players suggest cards they own)

Entropy-regularized decision-making (RL + game theory fusion)

Explore alternative game-theoretic models:

Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE)

Minimax Regret

🧠 Phase 6: Deep CFR + Neural Generalization
Goal: Scale to large games using function approximation.

✅ Deliverables
Replace regret tables with neural networks:

RegretNet (input: info set → output: regret values)

StrategyNet (input: info set → output: action probabilities)

Sample trajectories → store in replay buffer → train via mini-batch updates

Incorporate game history via:

MLP (basic)

LSTM (sequence modeling)

Transformer (if needed)

🎮 Phase 7: Evaluation & Opponent Testing
Goal: Measure performance and exploitability.

✅ Deliverables
Evaluation vs. random, logic-based, and humanlike bots

Metrics:

Win rate

Average number of turns

Accuracy of deductions

Bluff detection rate
