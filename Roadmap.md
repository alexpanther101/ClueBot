Phase 1: Core Game Simulation
🎯 Goal: Build a functional virtual version of Clue that bots can play

Game Setup

Implement GameRules class

Define Player class (can be bot or human)

Randomly select solution cards (1 suspect, 1 weapon, 1 room)

Shuffle and deal the rest to players

Game Loop

Turn-based structure

On each turn, allow:

Suggestion (suspect, weapon, room)

Response (next player shows one matching card if any)

(Optional) Accusation

Card Visibility

Track cards in each player’s hand

Track which card is shown to which player

Add a suggestion log: who suggested what, who showed what (or didn’t)

Game End Condition

Correct accusation → win

(Optional) Track failed accusations, eliminate that player from future turns

🔍 Phase 2: Information Tracking & Belief Modeling
🎯 Goal: Give bots memory and reasoning capabilities

Suggestion History

Log every suggestion (who suggested, what cards, who responded, what was shown)

Each player gets their own copy of visible history

Card Likelihood Matrix

For each player and each card, store a probability they have it:

python
Copy code
belief[player_id][card] = float
Update beliefs based on:

Known hands

Suggestions

Responses (or lack thereof)

Shown cards

Elimination Inference

If Player A suggests (Plum, Knife, Kitchen)

Player B responds, but I already hold Knife and Kitchen → they must have Plum

🎓 Phase 3: Bot Architecture
🎯 Goal: Add logic-based and learning-based bots

Rule-Based Bot

Uses deduction to eliminate suspects

Chooses suggestions to maximize new information

Random Bot

Selects suggestions randomly (good as baseline opponent)

Learning Bot

Wrap game logic in an RL-compatible interface:

get_state()

get_legal_actions()

step(action)

get_reward()

🧠 Phase 4: Reinforcement Learning Integration
🎯 Goal: Train bots to improve strategy over time

Define State Representation

Your hand

Cards you've seen

Belief matrix

Suggestion history

Turn number or phase

Define Action Space

Suggestions: all combinations of suspect/weapon/room

Accusation (optional)

Movement (if you later model the board)

Define Reward Signal

Win = +1

Loss = 0 or -1

Bonus: Reward inference accuracy or information gain

Implement RL Agent

Start with DQN, PPO, or policy gradient

Train via self-play

♟ Phase 5: Game Theory & Advanced Inference
🎯 Goal: Add strategic, opponent-aware intelligence

Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR)

Model Clue as a multi-agent extensive-form game

Implement CFR on top of simulator

Opponent Modeling

Track tendencies: Do they bluff? Reuse same suggestions?

Update beliefs about opponents' beliefs

Deception/Bait Strategies

Train bots to mislead others (suggest known cards)

Detect such behavior in others
